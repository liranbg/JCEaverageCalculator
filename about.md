## <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> The Vision
####Why we came up with the idea

At the [Jerusalem College of Engineering][JCE], students tend to monitor their grades day in and day out. They try to understand how their grade point average (GPA) was or will be affected by specific exams and whether it is worthwhile to try to take an exam again or to just let it be.

With this in mind, we decided to create a program that will give students access to their college accounts, dismantle the information given and present data in a user-friendly manner.

To start, we allow the courses and grades portion of the student portal to be imported directly into the program. A student’s transcript is then displayed as a table with the option to edit the given grades. With each edit, the student’s GPA will adjust accordingly.

Next, we gave students the ability to import their class schedules from the student portal into the program and with just three clicks, export it as a CSV file.

This type of file can be exported to many different calendars such as Google, iCal, and more! 
The next part of the program…okay, this part we will leave open for the future as we still have lots of ideas for future versions...
