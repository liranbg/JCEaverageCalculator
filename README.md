## <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> The Vision & Muse
####We - The *"JCE Manager Team"* got tired of the cluttered and non-friendly  Yedion Website.

The data at the website is "static", and we wanted **more** functions regarding data manipulation.
After all its **our** data...

for example, every semester we always needed to decide if we should take the chance and apply to another test. So, as all of us, we opened an excel spreadsheet and added formulas, and exhausting information...

*JCE computer sys admin* didn't want to give us a public API, so we needed so hack the website.

The project started as an [open API][openAPI] for the Yedion website, and rapidly changed to a full software!

Now we can fetch our Grade-Sheet in one click and manipulate the grades to see our GPA.
There is no need to enter each and every course to our Google Calendar every Semester! One click and we can import all the calendar to Google...

And we still have lots of ideas for future versions...
